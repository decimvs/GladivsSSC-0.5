# GladivsSSC-0.5
Gladivs Simple Screen Capture is an image editor an screenshots taker application. It's simple to use and very usefull.

Now is in a pre-alpha version. It takes screenshots from principal screen. You can draw shapes, like rectangles and ellipses.
You can render text. 

Planned features:

  - Image crop, resize, filters and effects.
  - More types of figures
  - Export in many formats
  - Formatted file type to save all raw data that can be edited later. This is a custom file format to save all work.
  - Open and edit extern images (Work like an image editor)

It is developed with Java. I'm using JDK8 and JavaFx.

You can run GladivsSSC under Windows 10 (tested) and Ubuntu 16.04, the first tests under Mac OS X 10.8 was without success. 
Note that under Ubuntu, with the bundled OpenJDK, GladivsSSC not run. GladivsSSC neds JavaFx libraries to work. These are
propietary of Oracle, but these are slowly opensourced by Oracle. Now there is and OpenJDK subproject, OpenFx that is working 
to port the open source version. I've tested without succes these librairies. So if you want to run under Linux, you must install
Oracle JRE8 or try to install OpenFx libraries. If you have succes installing OpenFx libraries and run GladivsSSC, please tell me
how you do it, so I can publish the procedure for other people interested.
